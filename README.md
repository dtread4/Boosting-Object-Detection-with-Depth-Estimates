# Boosting Object Detection with Depth Estimates
Can estimated depth maps improve object detection? This project explores the topic.

Still a work in progress!

## Datasets:
- COCO (2017): https://cocodataset.org/#download
- PASCAL VOC (2007, 2012): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayabhaskar96/pascal-voc-2007-and-2012


## Setup notes
- You may need to fix your PyTorch version after installing Depth Anything 3. The same goes for xFormers.
